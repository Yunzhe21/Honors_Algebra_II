## Honors Algebra II Homework Solutions

This is my homework solution for MATH-UA 349 Honors Algebra II, instructed by Professor Fedor Bogomolov. 

Topics includes: 
- Review of group theory
- Polynomial rings
- Fields and Galois extension
- Basic Algebraic Number Theory (quadratic number field)
- Introduction to representation theory of finite groups (Character, Character table, Tensor Product of representations)

Note: Please don't quote Problem 3 from HW3, which contains wrong statement. Also, Problem 3 from HW4 is still under construction.
